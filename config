# Third-party installed apps that we also extract strings from.  When adding a

# How should .po files be segmented?  See i18n/segment.py for details. Strings
# that are only found in a particular segment are segregated into that .po file
# so that translators can focus on separate parts of the product.
#
# We segregate Studio so we can provide new languages for LMS without having to
# also translate the Studio strings. LMS needs the strings from lms/* and
# common
segment:
    django-partial.po:          # This .po file..
        django-studio.po:       #  produces this .po file..
            - cms/*             #   by segregating strings from these files.
        # Anything that doesn't match a pattern stays in the original file.
